# Nbeats with RevIN normalization

In this project we have give list of 50 dataset in csv format. Each dataset contains 2 features "Value" and "Timestamps" that makes it univariate data. We have to take first 75% of each dataset for training and have submit the MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE evaluation numbers on the rest for testing.

In this project we use nbeats model and took its reference from Daniel Bourke #youtube(it is a must watch video if want to learn this topic), and for revin normalization part i took reference from mskbarah25 #repo.
